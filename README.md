# Authorization
Authorization NuGet solution based on Microsoft Identity and JWT


This NuGet project is in BETA version.

Current implementation allow to configure the project inside an API, providing methods for register and login users,
and retriving a JWT token for authenticate the rest of secured Controllers.

To know how to use the first beta version, take a look on ChustaSoft.Tools.Authorization.WebAPI project to see how is using it

NOTE: It is not neccesary to add any controller for authenticate, the target project could use the embedded controllers from the NuGet
